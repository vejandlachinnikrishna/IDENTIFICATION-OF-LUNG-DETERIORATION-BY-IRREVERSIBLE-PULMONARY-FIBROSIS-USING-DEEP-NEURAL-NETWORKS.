TITLE:
  IDENTIFICATION OF LUNG DETERIORATION BY IRREVERSIBLE
 PULMONARY FIBROSIS USING DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS

OVERVIEW:
 Pulmonary Fibrosis is a progressive and irreversible lung disease that causes scarring of the lungs and leads to breathing difficulties. Early diagnosis can improve patient outcomesâ€”but traditional methods are often slow, subjective, and resource-heavy.

This project aims to:
- **Automatically detect** whether a lung is affected by fibrosis using CT images.
- **Estimate the percentage** of lung area impacted.
